# Project Nexus ‚Äì ProDev Frontend Learnings

This repository documents my major learnings from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering program**. It‚Äôs my personal knowledge hub‚Äîcapturing concepts, tools, challenges, and insights I picked up along the way.

I‚Äôve always believed that before a user even tests if an app is functional, the **UI speaks first**. Just like we _eat with our eyes first_, good design and accessibility matter because everyone deserves to be included.

### Concepts & Practices

- **AI Prompting** ‚Üí The better the prompt, the better the response.
- **Requirements Analysis** ‚Üí Don‚Äôt just jump into coding; gathering requirements first saves tons of time later.
- **State Management** ‚Üí Essential for keeping apps predictable and user-friendly.
- **Accessibility & UI/UX** ‚Üí Everyone should feel included when using digital products.

## Challenges & Solutions

Throughout the program, I faced several challenges that pushed me to grow both technically and personally. Here‚Äôs how I approached them:

- **‚è≥ Work-Life Balance**  
  Balancing a 6‚Äì6 job with the demands of the program was tough. I overcame this by prioritizing tasks, planning my days more effectively, and sometimes putting in late nights. This strengthened my discipline and time management skills.

- **‚ö° Learning New Frameworks Quickly**  
  Jumping into technologies like **Next.js** and **TypeScript** felt overwhelming at first. I solved this by breaking concepts into smaller chunks, building mini-projects, and practicing consistently until I felt confident.

- **üìã Requirements Gathering**  
  My excitement for new projects often made me want to jump straight into coding. I learned the importance of gathering and analyzing requirements first‚Äîsaving time and preventing unnecessary rewrites later.

## Highlighted Project

- **Airbnb Clone**: A project where I applied Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript to build a real-world style app. This project helped me connect theory with practice.

## Best Practices & Personal Insights

- _‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a way and a solution to every problem, I just need to find it.‚Äù_
- Clean, accessible, and inclusive design always comes first.
- Collaboration (with both frontend and backend devs) is key to building complete, functional solutions.

## Collaboration

While I haven‚Äôt yet collaborated deeply with backend learners, I‚Äôm looking forward to it. Backend collaboration is essential for integrating APIs and creating full-stack experiences.

## Advice for Future Learners

You can do whatever you put your mind and energy to. Stay consistent, stay curious, and remember‚Äîrequirements first, code second.
